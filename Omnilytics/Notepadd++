  variace   14.5/ 3 = ???
  variance is ow much my data differs with in  it self 
  std is deviation accepted and expected into ur data

  eg) 65  54
      78  60
	  89  70
	  90  75
	  60  52, 58 
	  66  24
	  54  50
   somekind of value = some number of ice creeam is sold * .1.
      temper 30 celicus = 25
	  60 = 50
	  
	  
	  
	  what is biasnnes and what is the variance of model
